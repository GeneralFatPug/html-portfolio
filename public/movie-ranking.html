<h1>Top 3 Series of Watchable Entertainment</h1>
<h2>This is of my own opinion</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>So interesting how time travel works in the series. It shows the butterfly effect and how small decisions can have a big impact. Such as Marty accidentally hitting the one pine on twin pine farm. Later on in the movie when we see the mall again it's name is now lone pine mall</p>
<h3>Spiderman (Raimi films)</h3>
<p>Classic childhood film</p>
<h3>Golden Girls</h3>
<p>These old ladies are crazy. But so relateable you know.</p>
<p>It's a really good show that maintains quality throughout the series. It's easy to watch the complete series quickly</p>
<p>It also has a great theme song.<br/>
