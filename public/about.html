<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 24 year old computer programmer who is looking for a job in the field.
  I am working on a web development course in hopes of becoming a web developer.
  Whether it be front end, back end, or full stack.</p>

<p>I am also working on a solo developed video game with the rest of my time.
  I hope that that could lead me to further oppurtunities.</p>

  <p>I will update this website as I learn more in my course.</p>
